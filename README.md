# kv-orm
[kv-orm] is an [object-relational mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) for [key-value datastores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database).

**Warning! This package is still in active development, and breaking changes are possible and in fact, likely.**

## Features
* Support for multiple key-value datastores in a single application.
  ```typescript
  import { MemoryDatastore } from 'kv-orm-memory';

  const libraryDatastore = new MemoryDatastore();
  const applicationSecrets = new MemoryDatastore();
  ```
  
* Easy construction of typed entities using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
  ```typescript
  import { BaseEntity, Column, Entity } from 'kv-orm';

  @Entity(libraryDatastore)
  class Author extends BaseEntity {
  
    @Column()
    public firstName!: string;
  
    @Column()
    public lastName!: string;
  
    // ...
  }
  ```
  
* On-demand, lazy-loading: [kv-orm] won't load properties of a model until they're needed, and will do so seamlessly at the time of lookup.
  ```typescript
  let author = Author.get('bbed05da-594e-41d4-9b97-423343543e16'); // 1ms - no properties of the author have been loaded

  console.log(await author.firstName); // 60ms - author.firstName is fetched 
  ```

* No unnecessary reads: if a property is already in memory, [kv-orm] won't look it up again unless it needs to.
  ```typescript
  let author = Author.get('0486b183-270d-408a-a274-49b45c418c48');
  
  console.log(await author.lastName); // 60ms - author.lastName is fetched
  console.log(await author.lastName); // 1ms - author.lastName is retrieved from memory (no lookup performed)
  ```
  
* Writes and deletes are completed in the background â€” allowing your application to get on with what it needs to.
  ```typescript
  let author = Author.get('4bc148c5-af48-46ff-a620-3246efc69d91');
  
  author.firstName = 'Ernest';
  // Do more, immediately!
  ```


## Supported Datastores
* In-memory with [kv-orm-memory]
* [Cloudflare Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/) with [kv-orm-cf-workers]

If there is any other datastore that you'd like to see supported, please [create an issue](https://github.com/GregBrimble/kv-orm/issues/new), or make a pull request.
